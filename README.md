# Milling-pallet

A milling machine in a machining workshop has a tool change system. The tool changer holds tools and duplicate tools may be present. The operator must move trough
the tools either moving left or right. The tool changer is physically circular. Given the name of the tool needed, determine the min number of left or right moves/ steps
to reach it. An array of tools, starting index and target tool are available information. The origin of the problem is HackerRank (https://www.hackerrank.com/).
